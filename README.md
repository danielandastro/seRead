seread (stylised seRead) is a simple serial monitor written in c#, it uses the command line interface and is perfectly self
explainatory, currently has no advanced options like handshake and parity, for simplicity and also it is recieve only, I
use seRead for simple projects like arduino where serial communiction over USB can be used for debugging
